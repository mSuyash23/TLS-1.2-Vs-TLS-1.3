# TLS 1.2 vs TLS 1.3: What are the Main Differences?
TLS 1.3 offers several improvements over earlier versions, most notably a faster TLS handshake and simpler, more secure cipher suites. 
Zero Round-Trip Time (0-RTT) key exchanges further streamline the TLS handshake. Together, these changes provide better performance and stronger security.
